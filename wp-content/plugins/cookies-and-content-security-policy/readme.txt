Be fully GDPR and CCPA compliant through Content Security Policy. Blocks cookies and unwanted external content.

== Description ==

**Be fully GDPR and CCPA compliant through Content Security Policy.**
 
Block cookies and unwanted external content by setting Content Security Policy. A modal will be shown on the front end to let the visitor choose what kind of resources to accept. It also adds a layer of security for your site since iframes, scripts and images from unknown domains are blocked.

**Multilingual** support through [WPML](https://wpml.org/), [Polylang](https://polylang.pro/) or probably any multilingual plugin out there since this plugin follows WordPress Coding Standards. See FAQ below on how to translate with WPML or Polylang.
 
**Quickstart:** Choose common resources from a list that are automatically added to your Domains list. So, it's even easier to set it up! Check, check, check and check!
Updated regularly.

== Free stickers for translators! ==

**Since we want this plugin to be available in as many languages as possible, I will send you a handful of the new [super cool stickers](https://plugins.followmedarling.se/2022/02/stickers-are-in-the-house/) if you translate the plugin!** 
Just translate the plugin to your language, and when it is approved, [comment this post](https://plugins.followmedarling.se/2022/02/stickers-are-in-the-house/#respond) and I'll send it to you, totally free! 
If you have already translated the plugin and want stickers, of course that counts too! Just comment the post.

== Installation ==
 
Search for `Cookies and Content Security Policy` under Plugins on your WordPress install or download and:

1. Upload `cookies-and-content-security-policy` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > Cookies and Content Security Policy
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Does this make my site GDPR compliant? =
 
Yes, if you set it up right.

= Does this make my site CCPA compliant? =
 
Yes, if you set it up right.

= How do I know what resources are used on my site? =
 
After install, open a console (see screenshot 13) and see what is blocked by Content Security Policy. Then just go to WP Admin > Settings > Cookies and Content Security Policy > Domains and add the domains you want to allow. Or you can take a look at WP Admin > Settings > Cookies and Content Security Policy > Quickstart, and see if the resource you want to use is there.

= How do I manually add domains to allow? =
 
After install, open a console (see screenshot 13) and see what is blocked by Content Security Policy. If you get the error message:  `Refused to load the script 'https://domain.com/some-script.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src [...]` in the console, you should add `https://domain.com/` to Script, since `https://domain.com/` is the domain of the URL that caused the error, and `script-src` is the directive. If it is Always allow, Statistics, Experience or Marketing is up to you.

= The settings does not seem to have an effect. What do I do? =

There are three scenarios where this can happen:

* In some cases cookies are cached. It could be your hosting (for example WP Engine does this), then just contact them and ask them to uncache the cookies_and_content_security_policy cookie, or you can check "WP Engine compatibility mode" under Settings. 
* In other cases it could be your cache plugin (for example Litespeed cache does this), then just review your settings. Read more in the next question in the FAQ that is all about cache plugins.
* If you're using static page cache that doesn't go through php, go to Settings > Cookies and Content Security Policy > Settings and check Use meta under Advanced settings.

= I'm using a cache plugin, and it seems to be interfere with this plugin =

Review the settings of you cache plugin. 

Examples: 

* `Litespeed cache`, go to WP Admin > LiteSpeed Cache > Advanced, scroll down to "Vary Cookies" and enter `cookies_and_content_security_policy` and save your changes.
* `Hummingbird`, go to WP Admin > Hummingbird > Caching, scroll down to "Exclusions" and in "Cookies" enter `cookies_and_content_security_policy` and save your changes.
* `WP Fastest Cache`, go to WP Admin > WP Fastest Cache > Exclude, scroll down to "Exclude Cookies" and click "Add New Rule" and enter `cookies_and_content_security_policy` and save.

= Is the plugin responsive? =

Yes.

= Is the plugin translatable? =

Yes, all texts are translatable. There are 10+ languages already translated. And if you want to contribute with a translation of your own language, please do! <3 All texts on the front end can be changed directly in the admin. And if you are using WPML, Polylang, or some other multilanguage plugin, there is also support for multilanguage translations.

= How do I translate in WPML? =

1. Make sure you have "WPML String Translation" installed.
2. Go to Settings > Cookies and Content Security Policy > Texts and save your texts. 
3. Go to WPML > String Translation.
4. Search for "cacsp_" (without quotes).
5. Click the plus sign to add translation.
6. If you have a string named "cacsp_option_settings_policy_link", the value is a number. It is the ID of the Cookie policy page. Translate this by entering the ID of the cookie policy page in the language you are translating to.

= How do I translate in Polylang? =

1. Go to Settings > Cookies and Content Security Policy > Texts and save your texts. 
2. In the WordPress admin bar, choose "Show all languages".
3. Go to Languages > Strings translations.
4. In the "View all groups" dropdown, choose cookies-and-content-security-policy, and click "Filter".
5. Translate your texts in the form.
6. If you have a string named "cacsp_option_settings_policy_link", the value is a number. It is the ID of the Cookie policy page. Translate this by entering the ID of the cookie policy page in the language you are translating to.

= Can I change the look of it? =

Yes, there are settings for using a modal or a banner. Also you can choose if the site should be locked behind the modal or if the site should be usable without setting your preferences. You can also change the colors of everything. And if you want you can disable the css entirely and use your own. 

= Does it include a cookie policy page? =

No, but you can make your own, and in the settings you can select it and the modal won't show there so that the user can read it without accepting first.

= What if the user wants to change their settings? =

You can add a link anywhere on your site that links to `#cookiesAndContentPolicySettings` and clicking that will open the settings.

= Are the css and js files minified? =

Yes, but you also get them unminified and the css also comes as SASS so you can change anything.

= Can I bypass the plugin for testing purposes? =

Yes, just add the querystring ?cacsp_bypass=true to your url, when running speedtest in Gmetrix for instance. It will set a session cookie that accepts all Domains you've set.

You can also bypass all visitors by IP address(es) to avoid consent for testing tools or your office.

= Does it work with page builders? =

Yes! Not all are tested, but all tested works!

These have been tested:

* Divi
* Beaver Builder
* WPBakery Page Builder
* Elementor

= Does it work with Multisite? =

Defenetly! Just go to Network Admin > Settings > Cookies and Content Security Policy and choose how you want it to work. 

You can choose if all settings should be individual for each site, all settings should be fetched from your main site, or if all settings except texts should be fetched from your main site. 

= Does it support Google Consent Mode v2? =

Yes, it does! You can activate it in Settings > Cookies and Content Security Policy > Settings > Advanced settings > Enable Google Consent Mode v2

= Does it save the consent data? =

Yes, if you go to Settings and check "Save proof of consent". The consent data is saved in the database table "your_prefix" + "cacsp_consent". By default, the prefix is "wp_", so in most cases the table is named "wp_cacsp_consent".

== Screenshots ==
 
1. First modal, when using default colors.

2. Second modal, when using default colors.

3. Banner, when using default colors. Replaces First modal, when the setting "Do not use a modal, I want a banner." is used.

4. First modal, example of customized colors.

5. Second modal, example of customized colors.

6. Banner, example of customized colors.

7. Activate, by default when installing, the plugin is deactivated, choose admin to test your settings before going live just to check out if everything works.

8. Quickstart, choose from a long list of common resources to get started super quick.

9. Domains, this is where you white list all the domains where you allow content to be served from.

10. Texts, use the default texts or write your own. This is also fully multi language supported.

11. Settings, cusomize it how you like it.

12. Colors, without knowing css or anything, customize the colors to fit your site.

13. Look in console to see what is blocked. In this case you'd probably like to add https://platform.twitter.com/ to Experience > Script. Or just use Quickstart and choose Twitter.
